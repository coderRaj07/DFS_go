why it is failing in linux



There could be several reasons why the installation of `gopls` is failing on your Linux system. Here are some common troubleshooting steps you can follow:

### 1. Ensure Go is Installed Correctly
Make sure Go is properly installed on your system. You can verify this by running:
```sh
go version
```

### 2. Set Go Environment Variables
Ensure your `GOPATH` and `GOROOT` are set correctly. You can check and set them using:
```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
```

### 3. Update Go to the Latest Version
Ensure you are using the latest version of Go. You can download it from the official Go website: [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

### 4. Check for Dependencies
Ensure all necessary dependencies are installed. You can run:
```sh
go get -u golang.org/x/tools/gopls
```

### 5. Clean Go Module Cache
If the above steps don't work, you can try cleaning the module cache:
```sh
go clean -modcache
```

### 6. Install gopls Verbosely
Run the installation command with verbose output to get more details about the error:
```sh
go install -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

### 7. Check Permissions
Make sure you have the necessary permissions to write to the Go directories. You might need to use `sudo` if you're installing globally:
```sh
sudo go install -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

### Example Commands
Combining these steps, you might run something like this:
```sh
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
sudo go install -v golang.org/x/tools/gopls@latest
```

If these steps don't resolve the issue, please provide the exact error message you're seeing for further diagnosis.
